# Prefectural
Prefectural Webpage Game Project

Prefectural is a Wordle-inpsired game where every day a new Japanese prefecture is given to guess.

The game uses a pseudo-random number generator seeded by the date to generate consistently across different devices so it runs entirely client-side. The game also has a Japanese mode which allows Japanese input (auto-enabling Japanese IME) and the game caches game data to save progress on a given day. Streaks are also maintained and displayed for playing the game multiple days in a row.

This was my first full project developing so it is not completely polished.
